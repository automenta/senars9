# Code Guidelines

- Elegant
- Consolidated
- Consistent
- Organized
- Deeply deduplicated: Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

- Abstract
- Modularized
- Parameterized

- Terse syntax: ternary, switch, etc
- Few comments: rely on self-documenting code

- Purpose: professional, not explanatory/educational

- Unit testing: avoid using (and reduce reliance on) Mocks; test objects directly. Use the system's own event/metric
  APIs to test correct functionality.
