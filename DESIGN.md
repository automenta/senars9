## 3. Core Data Structures

### 3.1. `Term` Class

The `Term` class will be the cornerstone of the system, designed for strict immutability and robust operations.

**Key Features:**

-   **Strict Immutability:** Once created, a `Term` instance cannot be modified. All internal data structures will be frozen or deeply immutable. This simplifies reasoning about state and enables efficient caching.
-   **Equality, Comparators, and Hashcode:**
    -   `equals(otherTerm)`: Deep equality comparison, considering structure and content.
    -   `hashCode()`: A consistent hash code generation for efficient use in `Map`s and `Set`s. This will be pre-calculated upon creation and stored.
    -   `compareTo(otherTerm)`: For ordered collections (if needed).
-   **Factory Construction (`TermFactory`):**
    -   All `Term` instances will be created via `TermFactory.create(termExpression)`.
    -   The factory will handle parsing of Narsese-like string expressions into concrete `Term` objects.
    -   **Reduction and Normalization:** The factory will automatically perform canonical reductions for compound terms, such as:
        -   Commutativity for operators like `&` (conjunction), `|` (disjunction): `(&, B, A)` will normalize to `(&, A, B)`.
        -   Associativity for operators: `(&, A, (&, B, C))` will normalize to `(&, A, B, C)`.
        -   Elimination of redundancies: `(&, A, A)` normalizes to `A`.
    -   **Caching:** The factory will cache `Term` instances to ensure that identical terms (after normalization) always refer to the same object, optimizing memory and equality checks.
-   **Properties:**
    -   `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., hash code or canonical string representation).
    -   `operator`: The main operator of the term (e.g., `&`, `-->`, `_`).
    -   `arity`: Number of direct sub-terms.
    -   `complexity`: A numerical measure of the term's structural complexity.
    -   `isAtomic`, `isCompound`, `isVariable`, `isStatement`, etc.
-   **Sub-term Accessors:**
    -   `getComponent(index)`: Access a direct sub-term by its 0-based index.
    -   `getComponents()`: Returns an immutable array of direct sub-terms.
    -   `getAllSubTerms()`: Returns a flattened, unique list of all sub-terms (including nested ones).
-   **Sub-term Visitors:**
    -   `visit(visitorFunction)`: Traverses the term structure, applying a function to each sub-term (pre-order, in-order, post-order options).
-   **Sub-term Reducers:**
    -   `reduce(reducerFunction, initialValue)`: Applies a reducer function across the term structure to aggregate a result.

### 3.2. `Task` Class

The `Task` class represents a unit of work or information within the system, also designed for robustness and clarity.

**Key Features:**

-   **Immutability:** `Task` instances will be immutable.
-   **Properties:**
    -   `term`: The `Term` instance associated with this task.
    -   `truth`: An object representing the truth value (e.g., `{ frequency: 0.9, confidence: 0.8 }`).
    -   `stamp`: An object containing metadata about the task's origin and evidence, including creation timestamp, source, and derivation history.
    -   `priority`: A numerical value indicating the task's urgency or importance in memory.
    -   `type`: An enum or string indicating the task's nature (e.g., `INHERITANCE`, `BELIEF`, `GOAL`, `QUESTION`).
    -   `budget`: Resources allocated to the task for processing.
-   **Methods:**
    -   `derive(newTruth, newStamp)`: Creates a new `Task` instance based on the current one but with updated truth and stamp, ensuring immutability.

## 4. Core System Components

### 4.1. `NAR` (NARS Reasoner Engine)

The `NAR` class serves as the central orchestrator and public API for the entire reasoning system.

**API:**

-   `constructor(config: SystemConfig)`:
    -   Initializes the `Memory`, `Focus`, `RuleEngine`, `TaskManager`, and `Cycle` with the provided configuration.
    -   `SystemConfig` will specify rule sets (NAL, LM), memory parameters, and other system-wide settings.
-   `input(narseseString: string)`: Parses a Narsese string, creates a `Task`, and adds it to the `TaskManager` and `Memory`.
-   `on(eventName: string, callback: Function)`: Registers event listeners for various system outputs and internal events (e.g., `'output'`, `'belief_updated'`, `'question_answered'`, `'cycle_start'`, `'cycle_end'`).
-   `start()`: Initiates the continuous reasoning cycle.
-   `stop()`: Halts the reasoning cycle.
-   `step()`: Executes a single reasoning cycle, useful for debugging and controlled execution.
-   `getBeliefs(queryTerm?: Term)`: Returns a collection of current beliefs from memory, optionally filtered by a query term.
-   `query(questionTerm: Term)`: Submits a question to the system and returns a promise that resolves with the answer.
-   `reset()`: Clears memory and resets the system to its initial state.

### 4.2. Memory and Focus Management

The `Memory` component manages both long-term memory and short-term attention focus sets through the `Focus` system:

-   **Structure:** Uses a `Map<Term, Concept>` for efficient lookup of concepts by their associated terms.
-   **Dual Memory Architecture:** Separates focus sets (short-term memory) from long-term memory:
    - **Focus Sets:** Priority-based attention focus sets for immediate processing
    - **Long-term Memory:** Storage for all other tasks and concepts
-   **Index Management:** Specialized indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, similarity, etc.)
-   **Concept:** Each concept holds related tasks, ordered by priority, and stores metadata.
-   **Operations:**
    -   `addConcept(term: Term)`: Creates and adds a new concept.
    -   `getConcept(term: Term)`: Retrieves a concept.
    -   `addOrUpdateTask(task: Task)`: Adds a task to the relevant concept's storage.
    -   `consolidate(currentTime)`: Moves tasks between focus and long-term memory based on priority.

### 4.3. `Focus` and `FocusSetSelector`

Manages attention focus sets (short-term memory):

- **Short-term Memory Management**: Implements attention focus sets that represent short-term memory
- **Focus Set Management**: Creating and managing multiple named focus sets with configurable sizes
- **Priority-Based Selection**: Selecting high-priority tasks from focus sets using configurable selection strategies
- **Attention Scoring**: Maintaining attention scores for focus sets to determine their relevance
- **Task Promotion**: Mechanism for promoting high-priority tasks from focus (short-term) to long-term memory

The `FocusSetSelector` implements advanced task selection:

- **Composite Scoring**: Combining priority, urgency (time since last access), and cognitive diversity
- **Adaptive Selection**: Configurable parameters for priority thresholds, urgency weighting, and diversity factors
- **Cognitive Diversity**: Consideration of term complexity to promote reasoning diversity

### 4.4. `Cycle` and Task Processing

The `Cycle` orchestrates the flow of reasoning within the `NAR` system:

1.  **Task Selection:** Uses the `FocusSetSelector` to choose tasks from the focus set.
2.  **Rule Application:** The selected tasks are passed to the `RuleEngine`.
3.  **Inference & Derivation:** The `RuleEngine` applies relevant NAL and LM rules, generating new `Task`s (inferences, derivations, questions, goals).
4.  **Memory Update:** New and updated `Task`s are integrated back into `Memory`.
5.  **Output Generation:** Significant inferences or answers trigger output events.

### 4.5. `RuleEngine` and Rule Management

The `RuleEngine` manages and applies both NAL and LM rules with sophisticated management capabilities:

-   **Rule Types:** Supports both NAL inference rules and LM integration rules
-   **Rule Registration:** System for adding and categorizing different types of rules
-   **Enable/Disable Control:** Fine-grained control over which rules are active
-   **Group Management:** Ability to organize rules into groups and manage them collectively
-   **Rule Validation:** Validation of rule structure and functionality
-   **Performance Metrics:** Comprehensive tracking of rule execution performance
-   **Hybrid Reasoning:** Orchestrates NAL-LM integration through coordinated rule application
-   **Base Rule Interface:** Common interface defining `canApply()` and `apply()` methods

**Rule Classifications:**

- **NAL Rules:** Implement logical inference using NAL truth functions with pattern matching
- **LM Rules:** Interact with language models for enhanced reasoning, including prompt generation and response processing

### 4.6. Parser System

Handles Narsese syntax parsing and generation:

- **Statement Parsing**: Complete parsing of Narsese statements including term, punctuation, and optional truth value
- **Truth Value Extraction**: Recognition and parsing of truth value syntax `%f;c%` where f is frequency and c is confidence
- **Punctuation Recognition**: Support for belief (.), goal (!), and question (?) punctuation
- **Term Parsing**: Recursive parsing of complex term structures
- **Atomic Term Handling**: Recognition of simple atomic terms
- **Compound Term Parsing**: Support for all NAL operator types:
  - Inheritance: `(A --> B)`
  - Similarity: `(A <-> B)`
  - Implication: `(A ==> B)`
  - Equivalence: `(A <=> B)`
  - Conjunction: `(&, A, B, ...)`
  - Disjunction: `(|, A, B, ...)`
  - Negation: `(--, A)`
  - Extensional sets: `{A, B, C}`
  - Intensional sets: `[A, B, C]`
  - Operations: `(A ^ B)`
  - Sequential conjunction: `(&/, A, B)`
  - Instance: `(A {{-- B)`
  - Property: `(A --}} B)`
  - Products: `(A, B, C)`
- **Nested Structure Support**: Proper parsing of nested compound terms with appropriate grouping
- **List Parsing**: Handling of comma-separated lists with respect for nested parentheses

### 4.7. Language Model Integration (`LM`)

Provides comprehensive language model capabilities:

- **Provider Management**: Registry and selection of multiple LM providers
- **Workflow Engine**: Support for complex LM-based reasoning workflows
- **Metrics Tracking**: Monitoring of LM usage, token counts, and processing times
- **Narsese Translation**: Conversion between Narsese and natural language
- **Resource Management**: Handling of LM resources and capacity

## 5. Algorithms and Implementation

### 5.1. Term Normalization Algorithm

The normalization algorithm in `TermFactory` must handle commutativity, associativity, and redundancy elimination efficiently:

1. **Parse Components:** If the term is compound, parse its components.
2. **Recursive Normalization:** Recursively normalize all sub-terms.
3. **Apply Operator Rules:**
   - For commutative operators (`&`, `|`, `+`, `*`): Sort components lexicographically by their string representation.
   - For associative operators (`&`, `|`): Flatten nested structures.
   - For redundancy: Remove duplicate components.
4. **Reconstruct Term:** Build the normalized term from the processed components.
5. **Cache Check:** Check the factory's cache for an existing equivalent term.
6. **Store/Return:** If found in cache, return the cached instance; otherwise, freeze the new term, store it in the cache, and return it.

### 5.2. Memory Management Algorithms

- **Consolidation:** Mechanism for moving tasks between short-term and long-term memory based on priority
- **Priority Decay:** Gradual reduction of task priority over time
- **Index Management:** Efficient indexes for different term types (inheritance, implication, similarity, etc.)

### 5.3. Truth Value Operations

Implement NAL-specific truth value calculations:

1. **Revision:** Combine two truth values with the same content but different evidence bases.
2. **Deduction:** Apply deduction rules with proper truth value propagation.
3. **Induction/Abduction:** Implement induction and abduction truth value calculations.
4. **Negation:** Properly calculate negated truth values.
5. **Expectation:** Calculate expectation values for decision making.

## 6. Addressing Known Issues

### 6.1. Term Handling (String Operations vs. Concrete Objects)

**Problem:** The current codebase often relies on string manipulations for `Term` operations, leading to fragility, inefficiency, and difficulty in ensuring correctness (e.g., `(&, A, B)` vs. `(&, B, A)` being treated as different).

**Solution:** The re-implementation will strictly enforce the use of the `Term` class as a concrete, immutable object. All `Term` manipulations will be performed through its defined methods or the `TermFactory`.

-   **Parsing:** A dedicated `NarseseParser` (within `term/`) will convert Narsese string inputs into `Term` objects.
-   **Canonical Representation:** `TermFactory` will ensure that all logically equivalent terms (e.g., due to commutativity or associativity) resolve to the same canonical `Term` object, eliminating string comparison issues.
-   **Sub-term Operations:** `Term` will provide robust methods for accessing, visiting, and reducing sub-terms, ensuring operations are semantic rather than syntactic.

## 7. Testing Strategy

### 7.1. Unit Tests

-   **Granularity:** Each class and significant function will have its own dedicated unit test file.
-   **Focus:** Unit tests will verify the correctness of individual components in isolation.
-   **`Term` Class:** Extensive unit tests for `Term`'s immutability, equality, hash code, factory construction (including all reduction and commutativity rules), properties, and sub-term access/visitor/reducer methods.
-   **`Task` Class:** Unit tests for immutability, property access, and `derive` method.
-   **`Bag` and `Memory`:** Tests for correct priority-based storage, retrieval, and updates.
-   **`RuleEngine` and Rules:** Tests for individual rule application and correct inference generation.

### 7.2. Integration Tests

-   **Focus:** Verify the correct interaction between multiple components and the overall system behavior.
-   **`NAR` Integration:** Tests will primarily target the `NAR` class, simulating real-world input sequences and asserting expected outputs and changes in the belief base.
-   **NAL-LM Hybrid:** Specific integration tests will ensure the seamless interplay between NAL and LM rules within the `RuleEngine`.

### 7.3. Fluent Reasoner Test API

A fluent, expressive API will be developed to simplify the writing and reading of integration tests for the `NAR` system.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
import { createReasoner } from '../support/fluentReasonerAPI';

describe('NAR System Deductions', () => {
  let nar;

  beforeEach(() => {
    nar = createReasoner();
  });

  test('should deduce a simple conclusion from two premises', async () => {
    nar.input('<A --> B>.');
    nar.input('<B --> C>.');

    await nar.cycles(5); // Run for a few cycles to allow inference

    nar.expectBelief('<A --> C>.').toHaveTruth({ frequency: 1.0, confidence: 0.9 });
  });

  test('should answer a question based on existing beliefs', async () => {
    nar.input('<dog --> animal>.');
    nar.input('<cat --> animal>.');

    await nar.cycles(10);

    const answer = await nar.query('<dog --> ?x>.');
    expect(answer).toBeInferred('<dog --> animal>.');
  });

  test('should handle contradictory evidence', async () => {
    nar.input('<sky --> blue>{1.0, 0.9}.');
    nar.input('<sky --> blue>{0.0, 0.9}.'); // Contradictory evidence

    await nar.cycles(5);

    nar.expectBelief('<sky --> blue>.').toHaveTruth({ frequency: 0.5, confidence: expect.any(Number) });
  });
});
```

This API will abstract away the complexities of direct memory inspection and cycle management, allowing tests to focus on the logical behavior of the reasoner.

class Term {
  constructor(components, operator = null) {
    // Store components as immutable array
    this._components = Object.freeze([...components]);
    this._operator = operator;
    this._id = this.calculateId(); // Cache immutable ID
    this._hashCode = this.calculateHashCode(); // Cache hash code
    this._complexity = this.calculateComplexity(); // Cache complexity
    
    // Freeze the entire object to ensure strict immutability
    Object.freeze(this);
  }
  
  // Getters return immutable data
  get components() {
    return this._components;
  }
  
  get operator() {
    return this._operator;
  }
  
  get id() {
    return this._id;
  }
  
  // Immutable operations return new Term instances
  withAddedComponent(component) {
    return TermFactory.create([...this._components, component]);
  }
  
  // Structural comparison
  equals(otherTerm) {
    if (!(otherTerm instanceof Term)) return false;
    if (this._hashCode !== otherTerm._hashCode) return false;
    // Deep comparison logic here
  }
  
  hashCode() {

  }
  
  // Sub-term operations
  visit(visitorFn, order = 'pre-order') {
    visitorFn(this);

  }
  
  reduce(reducerFn, initialValue) {

    for (const comp of this._components) {
      result = comp.reduce(reducerFn, result);
    }
    return result;
  }

      return `(${this._operator}, ${this._components.map(c => c.toString()).join(', ')})`;
    } else {
      return this._components.join('');
    }

}
```

## 14. Future Considerations

-   **Distributed NARS:** Design for multiple `NAR` instances to communicate and share knowledge.
-   **Sensory-Motor Interface:** Integration with external environments for perception and action.
-   **Learning Mechanisms:** More advanced learning algorithms beyond basic NAL inference.

## 15. Hybrid NAL-LM Reasoning Integration

### 15.1. LM-Enhanced Term Generation

The system will use language models to suggest new terms or relationships when NAL alone cannot make progress:

1. **Gap Detection:** Identify reasoning gaps where NAL rules cannot derive new knowledge
2. **LM Query Generation:** Convert the reasoning context to natural language for LM input
3. **Response Processing:** Parse LM responses back to Narsese terms
4. **Validation:** Validate LM-generated terms against consistency constraints
5. **Integration:** Merge validated terms with existing knowledge base

### 15.2. Cross-Validation Between NAL and LM

Implement mechanisms to validate LM-generated inferences against NAL consistency:

- Use NAL to verify logical consistency of LM-proposed relationships
- Use statistical confidence from LM to weight NAL-derived truth values
- Detect and resolve contradictions between NAL and LM outputs

### 15.3. Dynamic Rule Selection

The system will adaptively select between NAL and LM reasoning based on:

- Task complexity and type
- Available evidence in memory
- Performance metrics of previous inferences
- Confidence thresholds for different reasoning paths

## 16. Additional Implementation Considerations

### 16.1. Bag Data Structure (Priority Queue)

The `Bag` will implement an efficient priority queue mechanism for task selection:

1. **Storage:** Use a balanced binary heap or similar structure to maintain priority ordering.
2. **Insertion:** Add tasks based on their priority value, maintaining heap property.
3. **Selection:** Implement probabilistic selection based on priority weights rather than strict priority to allow lower-priority tasks occasional processing.
4. **Removal:** Remove tasks based on priority and internal criteria, maintaining structure.
5. **Capacity Management:** Implement decay mechanisms to remove lowest-priority items when capacity is exceeded.

### 16.2. Rule Matching and Application Algorithm

The `RuleEngine` must efficiently identify and apply relevant rules:

1. **Indexing:** Maintain indexes of rules by applicable term types and structures.
2. **Pattern Matching:** Use structural pattern matching to quickly identify applicable rules for a given task.
3. **Context Building:** Gather relevant context from memory (related concepts, beliefs, etc.) for rule application.
4. **Application:** Execute applicable rules, collecting derived tasks.
5. **Output Filtering:** Filter outputs based on truth value thresholds and relevance criteria.

### 16.3. Concept Activation and Forgetting

1. **Activation Propagation:** When a task is processed, propagate activation to related concepts based on term similarity and relationship strength.
2. **Decay Mechanism:** Implement exponential decay of concept activation over time.
3. **Forgetting Policy:** Remove concepts with activation below a threshold or based on recency and importance metrics.
4. **Task Prioritization:** Use concept activation to influence task selection priority.

### 16.4. Testing Implementation Details

#### Property-Based Testing

In addition to unit and integration tests, implement property-based testing for complex algorithms:

- Term normalization properties (commutativity, associativity preservation)
- Truth value operation properties (consistency, range adherence)

#### Performance Regression Testing

- Benchmark key operations (term creation, rule application, memory access)
- Monitor performance metrics across development iterations
- Automated performance regression detection
